# Syntactical File Carving and Automated Generation of Reproducible Datasets
This repository contains supplementary material for our paper “Syntactical File Carving and Automated Generation of Reproducible Datasets” accepted at the DFRWS USA 2019.

You can find the published paper [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S174228761930163X) and on the [conference website](https://dfrws.org/conferences/dfrws-usa-2019/sessions/syntactical-file-carving-and-automated-generation-reproducible).

Note that the software we wrote and used is under active development and will be published in separate repositories.
Consider this repository as a meta repository indicating where to find the supplementary material.

## A Framework to Generate File Carving Test Data
The file carving test data generation framework has been named Woodblock. You can find it [here](https://github.com/fkie-cad/woodblock).

## Dataset
The dataset we used in our evaluation is available on [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3368393):
